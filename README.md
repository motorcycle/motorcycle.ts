## Developing

### Requirements

* Latest stable version of [Node](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
* Latest stable version of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

### For generating changelog (for those with NPM publishing rights)

* [Ruby >= v2.1.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
* [Github Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
  - Save the access token you generated for later usage

In your terminal, run the following:

**Note:** `sudo` may be required for all of the following terminal commands.

```sh
# If you're on a Debian-based Linux Distribution, install rake
gem install rake

# Install Github Changelog Generator
gem install github_changelog_generator
```

In your `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc` or equivalent shell configuration file, add the 
following:

```sh
export CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN=$GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_GENERATED_ABOVE
```

In a new terminal, you should now be able to successfully run `yarn changelog`
to generate an up-to-date `CHANGELOG.md`.
